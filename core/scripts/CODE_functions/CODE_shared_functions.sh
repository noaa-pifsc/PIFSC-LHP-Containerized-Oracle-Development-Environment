# this function loops through each of the project folders and executes any defined hook scripts for the project based on the specified timing and scope
# this function accepts the following parameters:
# 1: hook_timing - "pre" for hooks that run before the main action for the defined scope and "post" for hooks that run after the main action for the defined scope
# 2: hook_scope: this argument specifies one of the following values to determine which scope is being executed
#    -	client_local: For local CODE deployments, the main action is building and deploying the CODE container stack. 
#	 -	client_server: For server deployments, the main action is executing the bash script with a privileged user to deploy the container remotely on the container host  
#	 -	host_prep: For server CODE deployments, the main action is running the host deployment process with the privileged container user
#	 -	host_deploy: For server CODE deployments, the main action is building and deploying the CODE container stack
# 	 -	container: The main action is executing the database scripts to update the database and/or install apex application(s)
# 3: project_inheritance_var: array variable name that stores the inheritance information for the different forked CODE projects related to the current project
# 4: projects_path is the absolute path to the /projects folder in the root repository directory
