# PIFSC Life History Program Containerized Oracle Developer Environment

## Overview
The PIFSC Containerized Oracle Developer Environment (CODE) project was developed to provide a containerized Oracle development environment for PIFSC software developers. The Life History Program (LHP) data system was forked from the CODE project or a downstream forked CODE project to extend the CODE project's functionality and integrate LHP's dependencies. This repository can be forked to extend the existing functionality to any data systems that depend on the LHP for both development and testing purposes.
